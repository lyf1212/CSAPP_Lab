I finished CSAPP-BombLab, with one and a half day.
I don't think this is a hard-core assignment. But it is REALLY FUN~

With a SUPRISE, I find I have done attackLab.
The last phase is really hard. Maybe I should take it again some time in the future.

Thanks for anyone who helps me in PKUHOLE and Zhihu. I cannot get this 6.28 CPE in the end without your help.
I tried a lot of methods to optimize this subtle program, and some of those are neg-optimization.
Anyway, I got a lot of experience of program-optimization and pipeline-modifycation. 
What's more, I get enjoyness during solving numbers of difficult programs.
This is really a high-level free LAB. I finish it may be by some ocassional sense.
