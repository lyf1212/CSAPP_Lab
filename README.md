I finished CSAPP-BombLab, with one and a half day.
I don't think this is a hard-core assignment. But it is REALLY FUN~

With a SUPRISE, I find I have done attackLab.
The last phase is really hard. Maybe I should take it again some time in the future.

Thanks for anyone who helps me in PKUHOLE and Zhihu. I cannot get this 6.28 CPE in the end without your help.
I tried a lot of methods to optimize this subtle program, and some of those are neg-optimization.
Anyway, I got a lot of experience of program-optimization and pipeline-modifycation. 
What's more, I get enjoyness during solving numbers of difficult programs.
This is really a high-level free LAB. I finish it may be by some ocassional sense.

In a kind of silence after the mid-examination, I finish this little LAB in one and a half day.
Part A is interesting for a noob who without the experience about write a program with "getopt".
Part B is a bit difficult,because I have to analyis the mapping between Cache_Block and int_matrix.
For 64\*64 section, I have to google for effective solution.
By the way, I have to say that the difficulty curve of Part B is NOT appropriate.32\*32 and 60\*68 is so easy but 64*64 needs so many tricks.
Anyway, I have finished this LAB. I have to rethink Part B_64\*64 at some time.
